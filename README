The build is controlled via Makefile variables. In general
you should be able to build using:

  $ make
  $ make install

To change the target prefix, for example:

  $ make install PREFIX=/opt/key-tools

The Makefile picks up additional variables from a .config file
in the source directory. You will prefer to use this if you want
to control build flags for testing and debugging.
